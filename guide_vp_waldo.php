		<h4>Vice President (VP)</h4>

		<p>So you have a bit of a sweet tooth. Maybe dessert with the V.P. will take care of that. This post will only address successful techniques for surviving the "Piefest" at the end of promotion. After the traditional battle finishes you have to jump up under the toon in the cage and activate your pie supply. You have accomplished this when you get an indicator at the top of the screen. Quickly run to the side of the V.P. and face him. Put a little distance between yourself and the V.P.. Now comes the tricky part.</p>

		<p>Surviving the V.P. battle requires some skill. There are three ways to suffer damage at the hand of the V.P.. First is contact with the V.P. Usually a -1 on your Laff. Prevention of this type of damage is self-explanatory. The second way to be injured is flying parts. All those pies gum up the works. Hurts a little more with a -3 on your Laff. These are largely unavoidable in effective battle positions. There is a maximum range for this flying debris. Experiment with this in battle. The third type of battle damage is the most severe with a -10 on your Laff. This is quake damage that occurs when the V.P. lands after jumping. Now that Toontown has patched the MIDI bugs and we can promote with the sound turned on. The V.P. makes a very distinct sound as he prepares to jump. Learn this sound quickly to survive. A light tap on the Ctrl key and he can safely jump over the threat. Remember the damage occurs as he lands from his jump. Practice this and perfect this. The only way to survive is to learn self-preservation. Avoiding the quake damage is the key.</p>

		<p>So now you think you got a pretty good handle on the whole survival thing. Good because your supposed to be helping defeat this Super Cog. Attack. To throw a pie you will use the Ins key. Pay attention to the power meter at the top of the screen. When you depress the Ins key the power meter will begin to fluctuate. When the power meter is down to all white you will throw a line drive with your pie. When it is all they way charged and blue you will throw a high fly.</p>

		<p>There are two ways to assist in the destruction of the V.P.. You can either "drive him back" or you may choose to "Pie the hole". Sometimes it's necessary to do both in the course of the battle. I suggest you begin by learning to drive him back. You must drive him all the way down to the heliport then off the edge of the platform. Once one of the other players "pies the hole" the V.P. will crouch down and turn purple. Now is when he is ready to be driven towards the heliport. You must have a charged power meter to effectively drive the V.P.. Position yourself so your pie hits the upper portion of his body. Hitting steel is of no use at all. You MUST hit his shirt or above. Head shots are extra special. He must be CROUCHED and you must hit ABOVE the horizontal GEAR located at the bottom of his shirt. The best place to be is where he has been. Just simply follow him as you drive him towards the edge. Throw as fast as the power meter will allow.</p>

		<p>So your ready to try and pie the hole. Good luck. Want a quick advantage. Take a toon task to be a small toon for 30 days. Remember the doors that open to dispatch the cogs during the traditional portion of the battle. These are the achilles heel of the V.P.. One pie thrown cleanly in the hole will make him crouch. In the early stages of battle this can be quite simple. Get in the path of the cog. Sorry, this is the best and most dangerous spot. You can use the ramps to great advantage until he is all the way down on the heliport level. Remember a low or mostly white power meter is key here. Watch where your pies are hitting and adjust. I try to stand in line with the track on the machine. When he crouches and turns purple run backwards fast. Hopefully your teamtoons will drive him back in a hurry. When he is on the heliport your power meter must be TOTALLY down when throwing or the pie will be to high to score a hit. You must also be dangerously close. Careful. Watch that Laff Meter. When he is on the heliport you may wish to operate from the ramp behind the V.P.. Although must less accurate then close up it is much safer. Remember not to let up your assault or he will change directions and start back up the ramp. Yikes!</p>

		<p><strong>Addendum by Rattlebones</strong> : The CCG uses a lure left, destroy right tactic when fighting the cog waves. WeÂ’ve found this is generally the best way to ensure all 8 toons, no matter their experience or laff, will make it to the critical pie throw.</p>

		<p>... The lure left destroy right strategy entails luring all cogs forward then destroying the one on the right. When a new cog comes out you lure him (on the left) and destroy the rightmost cog. This ensure the cog most likely to wake up from lure will be the one being attacked.</p>
