		<h4>Our One Rule</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>No Elevator Shuffling &mdash; Once you load onto the elevator, stay on the elevator.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>That rule is based on our core belief:</h4>
		<p>Every toon deserves a shuffle-free elevator when they go to fight the boss and so we welcome everyone and we will load with anyone, regardless of suit/laff/gags.</p>
		
		<h4>A Few Guidelines</h4>
		<p>Several guidelines have been developed over the years to encourage teamwork and make the boss experience more fun for everyone.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Boarding groups are incompatible with our core belief &mdash; We don't select who we load with. We pack and go!</li>
			<li>Pack the elevators &mdash; No elevator should leave with empty slots. If you are on the loading platform, it is assumed you are ready to load. If there are vacancies on the elevator, pack on. If you are not ready to load, stay on the lower floor or outside.</li>
			<li><strong>Do not</strong> stand directly in front of the elevator as this blocks the view of those on the elevator &mdash; We use the Doodle phrase <em>"Rollover!"</em> to indicate that the elevator view is being blocked.</li>
			<li>No <abbr title="Pressing Alt+F4 to close the game window">F4ing</abbr> on the elevator unless 5 or less toons are onboard after the doors close.</li>
			<li>The preferred VP strategy of the CCG is <em>"Lure Left / Kill Right"</em>.</li>
			<li>The CCG does not approve of the use of any unfriendly chat &mdash; Whether it be stinky speedchat phrases used in an unfriendly way or hurtful use of SpeedChat+.</li>
			<li>Choose gags that will not endanger other toons &mdash; The boss cog fight is <strong>not</strong> the place to <em>"work"</em> your gags.</li>
			<li>Don't board the elevators before the official run time &mdash; We prefer everyone stay in the pit/outside though some cannot due to lag.</li>
			<li>No multi-tooning except in the last elevator to make a run happen and when no toons are left behind. Please keep your extra toon out of the lobby during regular boarding, and then get approval from teammates to bring them.</li>
			<li>Glitches are not acceptable on CCG runs.</li>
			<li>Work as a team. Everyone wants to win.</li>
			<li>Be nice &mdash; You don't know the human behind the toon.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Who can attend a CCG run?</h4>
		<p>Everyone may join us at our runs as long as they follow our rule and guidelines.</p>
